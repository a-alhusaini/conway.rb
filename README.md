# Conway.rb - CLI conway game in Ruby

During my journey to learn Ruby; I thought the best way to do so would be to make a project using the language and include things like tests.

The project itself should not be too easy nor too hard. Something I can complete by sitting down for a few days or a week.

.. But this is a conway game! why would it take a week to do?

Well, its a learning project. I'd often pause to explore parts of ruby to learn more about it. At one point, I spent a few hours learning about procs and blocks. On another occasion, i stopped to compare minitest and RSpec. Only to find that minitest has a way to impersonate RSpec ;)

After making these stops - among many others - I present to you the complete project.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/a-alhusaini/conway.rb"
cd conway.rb
bundle install
ruby main.rb
```
